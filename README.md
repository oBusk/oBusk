### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

My name is Oscar Busk, and I work for [Silobreaker](https://github.com/Silobreaker) as a frontend developer, working mainly with Typescript and Angular.

I really enjoy working with Typescript and I find [Next.js](https://github.com/vercel/next.js) and Node very interesting to play around with on my freetime.
